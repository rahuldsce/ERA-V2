# Backpropogation Manual Calculation

This Excel example demonstrates how to minimize loss to achieve matching input and target output values. It represents a fully connected layer with 2 inputs and 8 weights. Weight calculation utilizes backpropagation by determining the partial derivative of each weight with respect to the total loss.


This simple two-input problem demonstrates that a higher learning rate leads to faster loss reduction. A lower learning rate requires more training epochs (iterations) to approach zero loss.
